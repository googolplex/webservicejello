# webservicejello
my first app engine restfull webservice using jello framework http://jello-framework.com/


TAke into account all hidden folders
This project was done with eclipse mars, so it is possible
that with another eclipse version, some hidden files like .project
doesnt work anymore.

If this is the case just create an empty project and config again to
work with jello framework and app engine
then copy the content of this repo and everything should be ok

Before putting into production remember to regenerate all possible indexes
that you will need, just by clicking all posible queries that you will need.

Then recheck the file to see datastore-indexes-auto are regenerated.
